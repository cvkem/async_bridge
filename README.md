# async_bridge
A bridge between synchronous and async code for mixed sync/async programming

This crate contains a small library and two examples. First example shows that the async_bridge::run_async operates well in an synchronous context, while the second example shows that it reuses the runtime of the async main generated by Tokio Main.
